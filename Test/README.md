## Usage Guidelines

### File Organization
- Files are automatically organized based on type and content
- Use descriptive filenames with dates when applicable
- Avoid spaces in filenames; use underscores or hyphens instead

### Recommended Naming Conventions
- **Data files:** `YYYY-MM-DD_dataset_description.ext`
- **Analysis scripts:** `YYYY-MM-DD_analysis_description.py`  
- **Results:** `YYYY-MM-DD_result_description.ext`
- **Drafts:** `YYYY-MM-DD_draft_title.md`

### Getting Started
1. Place raw data in the appropriate data directory
2. Create analysis scripts in the code/notebooks directory
3. Save results and outputs to the results directory
4. Use the drafts folder for work-in-progress documents

### File Monitoring
This project is monitored by the Research File Manager. New files will be:
- Automatically indexed for semantic search
- Suggested for organization based on content and type
- Tracked for version control and collaboration
