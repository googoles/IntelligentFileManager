# Semantic Search Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the semantic search functionality implemented for the Research File Manager MVP.

## Overview

The semantic search system enables intelligent, similarity-based file search using vector embeddings. It uses the `sentence-transformers` library with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for generating embeddings and ChromaDB for vector storage and similarity search.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SemanticSearch Class** (`backend/search.py`)
   - Main class handling embedding generation and search operations
   - Manages ChromaDB integration and model initialization
   - Provides text chunking and batch processing capabilities

2. **Data Structures**
   - `SearchResult`: Contains file information and similarity scores
   - `TextChunk`: Represents text segments with metadata

3. **Vector Database**
   - ChromaDB with local persistence (`data/db/chroma/`)
   - Stores embeddings with metadata for efficient similarity search
   - Supports project-scoped and file-type-filtered queries

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization

```python
from backend.search import SemanticSearch, get_semantic_search

# Initialize with defaults
search_engine = get_semantic_search()

# Or initialize with custom settings
search_engine = SemanticSearch(
    model_name='all-MiniLM-L6-v2',
    chroma_path='./data/db/chroma',
    collection_name='file_embeddings'
)
```

### File Indexing

```python
# Index a single file
file_record = session.query(File).filter(File.id == file_id).first()
success = search_engine.index_file(file_record)

# Batch index multiple files
file_records = session.query(File).filter(File.project_id == project_id).all()
stats = search_engine.batch_index_files(file_records)
print(f"Indexed {stats['successful']} files successfully")
```

### Semantic Search

```python
# Basic search
results = search_engine.search("machine learning algorithms", top_k=5)

# Project-scoped search
results = search_engine.search(
    query="neural networks",
    project_id="project-123",
    top_k=10
)

# File type filtered search
results = search_engine.search(
    query="data analysis",
    file_types=['.py', '.ipynb'],
    similarity_threshold=0.5
)
```

### Similar File Discovery

```python
# Find similar files
similar_files = search_engine.find_similar_files(
    file_id="file-123",
    top_k=5,
    similarity_threshold=0.3
)

for result in similar_files:
    print(f"{result.file_name}: {result.similarity_score:.3f}")
```

### Utility Functions

```python
from backend.search import index_project_files, search_files

# Index all files in a project
stats = index_project_files("project-123", force_reindex=False)

# Convenience search function
results = search_files(
    query="research methodology",
    project_id="project-123"
)
```

## Configuration

The semantic search system integrates with the application configuration system:

```python
# Configuration options in config.py
EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
CHROMA_DB_PATH = 'data/db/chroma'
CHUNK_SIZE = 500
```

    results = search_files(query, project_id=project_id)
    return {"results": [result.to_dict() for result in results]}
```

### File Watcher Integration
Can be integrated with the file monitoring system for automatic indexing:

```python
# In file_watcher.py
def on_file_created(file_path):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Index new file
    search_engine = get_semantic_search()
    search_engine.index_file(file_record)
